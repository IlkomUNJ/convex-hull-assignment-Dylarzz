# Identity
Name : Darrell Rafif Alfarabi (1313623032)

# AI usage
I used Gemini to asked about the Assignment. First, I asked the AI to explain what a "Convex Hull" is in simple terms. Then I asked it to explain the "convexhull" and "slowconvex" algorithms needed for the assignment. Then asked the AI to write the basic C++ code for a Qt application with a drawing area based on the pseudo code. Finally, Id ask how to connect the UI buttons to the algorithm functions. If I got any errors, I would paste my code and asked some of the error message and ask the AI.

Such as:
- "How do I connect a button click to a function in Qt?"
- "Can you help me find the bug in this code?" (...and then I'd paste my code)
- "Give me the C++ code for a simple Qt drawing app."

# Collaboration usage
With my friend we discussed about the assignment, such as how the algorithm works, whats the difference between convexhull and slowconvex, how much the iteration needed, How to implement the pseudocode and etc. The friend I discussed the assignment with are Agastya Dava, Ryan, Darren, Adhitya, Fikri, Deric.
